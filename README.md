Remote Stove Controller (or Stove Guard) is an iOS application that enables remote control of stove devices over the internet. Our goal is to grant more flexibility to people who need to cook but also have to operate on tight clock schedule, or those who are simply tired to stand in the kitchen waiting for food to be ready. The Remote Stove Controller allows users to automate cooking routine, schedule tasks, and adjust heat levels all together from their iOS phone.
